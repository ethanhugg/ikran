/*
 * Wrapper - Helper class for wrapper objects.
 *
 * This helps to construct a shared_ptr object which wraps access to an underlying handle.
 * (The handle could be a pointer to some low-level type, a conventional C handle, an int ID, a GUID, etc.)
 *
 * Usage:
 *   To obtain a FooPtr from a foo_handle_t, call FooPtr Foo::wrap(foo_handle_t);
 *
 * To implement Foo using Wrapper, Foo needs to include this macro in its class definition:
 *   CSF_DECLARE_WRAP(Foo, foo_handle_t);
 * It also needs to include this in the cpp file, to provide the wrap() implementation and define the static Wrapper.
 *   CSF_IMPLEMENT_WRAP(Foo, foo_handle_t);
 * These are all declared in common/Wrapper.h - Foo.h needs to include this too.
 * The client needs to declare Foo(foo_handle_t) as private, and provide a suitable implementation, as well as
 *   implementing wrappers for any other functions to be exposed.
 * The client needs to implement ~Foo() to perform any cleanup as usual.
 *
 * wrap() will always return the same FooPtr for a given foo_handle_t, it will not construct additional objects
 *        if a suitable one already exists.
 * changeHandle() is used in rare cases where the underlying handle is changed, but the wrapper object is intended
 *                to remain.  This is the case for the "fake" CC_DPCall generated on CC_DPLine::CreateCall(), where
 *                the correct IDPCall* is provided later.
 * reset() is a cleanup step to wipe the handle map and allow memory to be reclaimed.
 *
 * Future enhancements:
 * - For now, objects remain in the map forever.  Better would be to add a releaseHandle() function which would
 *   allow the map to be emptied as underlying handles expired.  While we can't force the client to give up its
 *   shared_ptr<Foo> objects, we can remove our own copy, for instance on a call ended event.
