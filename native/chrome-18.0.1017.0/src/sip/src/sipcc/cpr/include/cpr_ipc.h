/**
 * Creates a message queue
 *
 * @brief The cprCreateMessageQueue function is called to allow the OS to
 * perform whatever work is needed to create a message queue.

 * If the name is present, CPR should assign this name to the message queue to assist in
 * debugging. The message queue depth is the second input parameter and is for 
 * setting the desired queue depth. This parameter may not be supported by all OS. 
 * Its primary intention is to set queue depth beyond the default queue depth
 * limitation. 
 * On any OS where there is no limit on the message queue depth or
 * its queue depth is sufficiently large then this parameter is ignored on that
 * OS.
 *
 * @param[in] name  - name of the message queue (optional)
 * @param[in] depth - the message queue depth, optional field which should
 *                default if set to zero(0)
 *
 * @return Msg queue handle or NULL if init failed, errno should be provided
 *
 * @note the actual message queue depth will be bounded by the
 *       standard system message queue depth and CPR_MAX_MSG_Q_DEPTH.
 *       If 'depth' is outside of the bounds, the value will be
 *       reset automatically.

 * function drains any messages from the queue and the frees the
 * message queue. Any messages on the queue are to be deleted, and not sent to the intended
 * recipient. It is the application's responsibility to ensure that no threads are 
 * blocked on a message queue when it is destroyed.

/**
  * cprSendMessage
 * @brief Place a message on a particular queue.  Note that caller may
 * block (see comments below)
 *
 * @param[in] msgQueue   - msg queue on which to place the message
 * @param[in] msg        - pointer to the msg to place on the queue
 * @param[in] ppUserData - pointer to a pointer to user defined data
 *
 * @return CPR_SUCCESS or CPR_FAILURE, errno should be provided
 *
 * @note 1. Messages queues are set to be non-blocking, those cases
 *       where the system call fails with a would-block error code
 *       (EAGAIN) the function will attempt other mechanisms described
 *       below.
 * @note 2. If enabled with an extended message queue, either via a
 *       call to cprCreateMessageQueue with depth value or a call to
 *       cprSetExtendMessageQueueDepth() (when unit testing), the message
 *       will be added to the extended message queue and the call will
 *       return successfully.  When room becomes available on the
 *       system's message queue, those messages will be added.
 * @note 3. If the message queue becomes full and no space is availabe
 *       on the extended message queue, then the function will attempt
 *       to resend the message up to CPR_ATTEMPTS_TO_SEND and the
 *       calling thread will *BLOCK* CPR_SND_TIMEOUT_WAIT_INTERVAL
 *       milliseconds after each failed attempt.  If unsuccessful
 *       after all attempts then EGAIN error code is returned.
 * @note 4. This applies to all CPR threads, including the timer thread.
 *       So it is possible that the timer thread would be forced to
 *       sleep which would have the effect of delaying all active
 *       timers.  The work to fix this rare situation is not considered
 *       worth the effort to fix....so just leaving as is.
