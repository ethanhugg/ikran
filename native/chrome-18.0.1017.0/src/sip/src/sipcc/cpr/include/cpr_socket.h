 * block up to the specified timeout interval for one of the conditions to be
 * true or until interrupted by a signal.
 *
 * File descriptor masks of type fd_set can be initialized and tested with
 * FD_CLR(), FD_ISSET(), FD_SET(), and FD_ZERO().  The OS-implementation may
 * implement these calls either as a macro definition or an actual function.
 * void FD_CLR(cpr_socket_t, fd_set *) shall remove the file descriptor fd from the
 * set. If fd is not a member of this set, there shall be no effect on theset.
 * int FD_ISSET(cpr_socket_t, fd_set *) shall evaluate to non-zero if the file
 * descriptor fd is a member of the set, and shall evaluate to zero otherwise.
 * void FD_SET(cpr_socket_t, fd_set *) shall add the file descriptor fd to the set.
 * If the file descriptor fd is already in this set, there shall be no effect on
 * the set.
 * void FD_ZERO(fd_set *) shall initialize the descriptor set to the null set.
 *
 * @param[in] nfds    Specifies the argument range of file descriptors to be tested. The
 *            descriptors from zero through nfds-1 in the descriptor sets shall be examined.

 * @param[in] read_fds    If not a null pointer, this is a pointer to an fd_set object.  
 *    @li On input this specifies the file descriptors to be checked for being ready to read.
 *    @li On output this specifies the file descriptors that are ready to read.
 *
 * @param[in] write_fds   If not a null pointer, this is a pointer to an fd_set object.  
 *    @li On input this specifies the file descriptors to be checked for being ready to write.

 *       return immediately if the socket is OK to write to, to indicate that a send, sendto,
 *       (or on Windows a WSASendto()) are guaranteed to succeed. You generally would not keep
 *       checking for write access in a loop, as cprSelect() would never get a chance to time
 *       out if the socket was generally available for a write operation. You should really
 *       only check for writability when you know you have something to write to a socket.
 *
 * @param[in] except_fds   If not a null pointer, this is a pointer to an fd_set object.

 *
 * @param[in] timeout If not a null pointer, this  points to an object of type struct cpr_timeval 
 *       that specifies the maximum time interval to wait for the selection to complete.  
 *       If timeout expires, the function shall return.  If the parameter is a null pointer, the function

 *
 * @note While this function supports multiple file descriptor types, only file descriptors referring to a

 * by the "soc" argument.
 * The level argument specifies the protocol level at which the option resides. To
 * set options at the socket level, specify the level argument as SOL_SOCKET. To
 * set options at other levels, supply the appropriate level identifier for the
 * protocol controlling the option. For example, to indicate that an option is
 * interpreted by the TCP (Transport Control Protocol), set level to IPPROTO_TCP
 * as defined in the <cpr_in.h> header.
 * The opt_name argument specifies a single option to set. The option_name
 * argument and any specified options are passed uninterpreted to the appropriate
 * protocol module. The <cpr_socket.h> header defines the socket-level options.
