 * @brief The cprSendTo() function is the CPR wrapper for the "send" socket API.
 *
 * The cprSendTo() function shall send a message through a socket. If the socket
 * is connectionless-mode, the message shall be sent to the address specified by
 * address. If the socket is connection-mode, address shall be ignored.
 * Delivery of the message is not guaranteed.
 * If space is not available at the sending socket to hold the message to be
 * transmitted, and the socket does not have non-blocking set, cprSendTo() shall
 * block until space is available; otherwise, if non-blocking is set, the
 * cprSendTo() call shall fail.
 * The cprSelect() function can be used to determine when it is possible to send
 * more data.
 *
 * @param[in] soc  Specifies the socket created with cprSocket() to send
 * @param[in] msg  A pointer to the buffer of the message to send.
 * @param[in] len  Specifies the length in bytes of the message pointed to by the buffer argument.
 * @param[in] flags   The socket options
 * @param[in] dest_addr Points to a cpr_sockaddr_t structure containing the destination
 *                    address.
 * @param[in] dest_len Specifies the length of the cpr_sockaddr_t structure pointed to by
 *                     the "dest_addr" argument.
 *
 * @return Upon successful completion, cprSend() shall return the number of
 *     bytes sent. Otherwise, SOCKET_ERROR shall be returned and cpr_errno set to
 *     indicate the error.
 *
 * @note The possible error values this function should return are
 *        @li [CPR_EBADF]  The socket argument is not a valid file descriptor
 *        @li [CPR_ENOTSOCK]  socket does not refer to a socket descriptor
 *        @li [CPR_EAGAIN]    The socket is marked non-blocking and no data can
 *                          be sent
 *        @li [CPR_EWOULDBLOCK]   Same as CPR_EAGAIN
 *        @li [CPR_ENOTCONN]  A connection-mode socket that is not connected
 *        @li [CPR_ENOTSUPP]  The specified flags are not supported for this
 *                            type of socket or protocol.
 *        @li [CPR_EMSGSIZE]  The message is too large to be sent all at once
 *        @li [CPR_EDESTADDRREQ]  The socket has no peer address set

 * option_name argument, at the protocol level specified by the "level" argument,
 * to the value pointed to by the "opt_val" argument for the socket specified
 * by the "soc" argument.
 * The level argument specifies the protocol level at which the option resides. To
 * set options at the socket level, specify the level argument as SOL_SOCKET. To
 * set options at other levels, supply the appropriate level identifier for the
 * protocol controlling the option. For example, to indicate that an option is
 * interpreted by the TCP (Transport Control Protocol), set level to IPPROTO_TCP
 * as defined in the <cpr_in.h> header.
 * The opt_name argument specifies a single option to set. The option_name
 * argument and any specified options are passed uninterpreted to the appropriate
 * protocol module. The <cpr_socket.h> header defines the socket-level options.
 *
 * @param[in] soc The socket on which the options need to be set
 * @param[in] level The protocol level at which the option resides
 * @param[in] opt_name This specifies the single option that is being set
