0. Introduction
---------------
  Ikran is an experimental addon for Firefox that turns your browser into a SIP endpoint 
  for both audio and video.  It currently uses WebRTC for audio/video media support.

  The ikran is a bird from the mythical world of Pandora (Avatar).  It is well known for
  its birdcall which travels long distances using widely accepted standards for audio and video.

  Ikran can operate in two modes. (1) Registration mode, where it is a SIP UA and registers with 
  a SIP server. (2) Peer to Peer Mode, where is can communicate directly with other ikran clients
  in the same mode using SIP.

1. Platform Support 
-------------------
Required for all platforms:
  Python (www.python.org) -  known to work with 2.6 & 2.7 
  SCons (www.scons.org) - 'sudo apt-get install scons' or 'sudo yum install scons'
  NOTE: You will need working builds of recent firefox and webrtc code source trees.
  MOZSRCPATH environment variable pointing to the a built source tree of Firefox (mozilla-central)    
  WEBRTCPATH environment variable pointing to a built webrtc source trunk
  
Linux:
  Should build on Ubuntu 11.04 or Fedora15
  Third-Party Libraries
  +libxml2 - sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
  +Glib    - sudo apt-get install libdbus-glib-1-dev
  +asound  - sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
  +libgtk  - sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev     
  +libidn  - sudo apt-get install libidn11-dev

Mac OSX:
  Built on OSX 10.7 with XCode 4.1 and OSX 10.6 with XCode 3.2.6
  Links to Framework 10.6, minimum version 10.5
  Requires libidl installed.  You can use MacPorts ("sudo port install libidl")

Windows:
  Built regularly on Windows XP & Windows 7 32bit.
  Python path is in runSconsBuild.py and set to c:\python27
  Requires setting following environment variables
  SCONS_LOCATION pointing to scons installation
  ZIP_LOCATION pointing to 7z zip installation (windows only)
  MS_WINDOWS_SDK_PATH pointing to Windows SDK path ( v7.1)
  MS_VC_PATH pointing to Visual Studio installation ( VS9.0)
  DXSDK_DIR pointing to Micrisoft DirectX SDK installation
	e.g SCONS_LOCATION=c:\Python26\Scripts
  
-----------
2. Building 
-----------
  - Get and build Mozilla
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Build_Documentation
      Set the MOZSRCPATH env variable to point to it - to the mozilla-central directory.
  - Build WEBRTC for video and audio engine libraries 
      +  Follow the instructions @ http://www.webrtc.org/reference/getting-started
      +  webtrc version > 595 has been tested. To download a specific version use 
		gclient sync --revision 595 
      +  Set WEBRTCPATH to point to it : export WEBRTCPATH=/Users/XTM/HTML5/webrtc/trunk
  - On Windows copy libxml2_MTd.lib from https://public.me.com/ethanhugg to /third_party/lib
  - Instead of using scons directly, use runSconsBuild.py like this
    'python runSconsBuild.py debug' or
    'python runSconsBuild.py clean'
    Current command line options are 'debug', 'release', 'clean', 'noaddon' and 'x64'.
    
---------
4. Output
---------
  Build will create a standalone test app and an addon for Firefox 4, 5 or 6.
  Test App Exe: TestApp_Softphone
  Addon: ikran-0.2-dev.xpi

--------------------
5. Testing the addon
--------------------
  To build  & test addon , follow below steps

  - Addon executable shall be generated under the <SOURCE>/ikran
 	 called ikran-0.2-dev.xpi
  - OSX 
	Start Firefox in 32 bit as 
		arch -i386 /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin 
  - Linux (32 bit and 64 bit)
	Connect your camera and make sure it works :)
	Start Firefox normally  
  - Install the addon
  - Test add-on with sample page at
		<SOURCE>/ikran/content/ikran.html		
NOTES:
1. ikran.html should be served from a server due to permission issues
   with file loaded locally (file://) 

-----------------------------
6. Using the Test Application
-----------------------------
Use the command line test application to exercise the SIP stack.
The test application can be used against Cisco Call Manager, Asterisk and Kamailio (OpenSER).
The test application requires the nspr4 library in your dynamic library path.  It is 
  easiest just to copy libnspr4.dylib/.so/.dll into the testapp directory from mozilla-central.

 Run the Test Application from the command line with no parameters
   ./tests/testapp_softphone/TestApp_SoftPhone

   ********************************
   Please Choose One :
         0. Quit
         1. Register User
         2. Place Call
         3. Answer Call
         4. End Call
	 5. Start P2P mode
	 6. Place P2P Call
   What Action do you want to perform Monsieur ??

   Select 1 to register, enter the following details, inside square brackets are defaults.

      Enter SIP Server IP Address [ 10.53.47.140 ]:
      Enter SIP Server username (phone DN for CUCM) [ 9995 ]:
      Enter Password (not required for CUCM [ Enter ]:
      Enter device name (only required for CUCM) [ emannionsip01 ]:

   Select 5 to start ikran in Peer to Peer mode.  This requires only the SIP username to start.

      Enter local peer username (usually a phone DN) [ 9995 ]:

   To make a P2P call select option 6, this will require remote SIP username and remote IP Address.


 When running the Test Application in Linux it operates slightly differently. To see the available
 list of commangs use the '?' key.

7. Addon API
------------
The JS API offers support for 
    SIP Registration, Place Call, HangUp Call, Answer Call, Send DTMF
    P2P Mode, Place P2P Call
    SetProperty, GetProperty

window.navigator.service.call obtains handle to session-control 
object. 

<session-control>.registerUser(user_device, user, credential, sip-proxy, sessObserver);
registers user to the sip-proxy. 

'sessObserver' is a JS function that will be called whenever there is 
a change in the session state such as "no-registrar","registering",
"registered", "incoming-call" & "registration-failed".

On successful registration, one can place call with the below API
<session-control>.placeCall(dial-number, canvas, mediaObserver);
where dial-number is number to dial and mediaObserver reports 
significant media state changes such as "call-connected",
"call-terminated" as of today.

JS APIs unRegisterUser() and hangupCall() allows de-registration
& end-call functionalities.

SendDigits API
To Send DTMF digits use sendDigits, a call must be active to send DTMF digits.
sendDigits('123#');

SetProperty API
Available properties are
localvoipport -- used in P2P mode
remotevoipport -- used in P2P mode
e.g.  Me.setProperty({"localvoipport": 5061, "remotevoipport": 5061});

GetProperty API
e.g.  var version = Me.getProperty("version");

Few Points to Note
1. One user is suported as registered by instance
 
Please see content/ikran.html for sample usage of the API.

----------------------------------
8. Configuring Asterisk SIP Server
----------------------------------

1. Create a SIP user in /etc/asterisk/sip.conf

  [bob]
  type=friend
  defaultuser=bob
  secret=1234
  host=dynamic
  context=ikran

2. Create a phone extension in /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf

  [ikran]
  extn => 1234,1,Dial(SIP/bob)
  
3. From the Asterisk CLI> sip reload  

---------------------------------
9. Configuring kamailo SIP Server
---------------------------------
Here is a good reference: http://www.oldskoolphreak.com/tfiles/voip/beginners_openser.txt

1. Create two users

  kamctl add userbob bobpassword bob@localhost
  kamctl add useralice alicepassword alice@localhost


2. Start kamailio

  /usr/local/sbin$ ./kamailio
