0. Introduction
---------------
  Ikran is an experimental addon for Firefox that turns your browser into a SIP endpoint 
  for both audio and video.  It currently uses GIPS for audio/video support.

  The ikran is a bird from the mythical world of Pandora (Avatar).  It is well known for
  its birdcall which travels long distances using widely accepted standards for audio and video.

1. Platform Support 
--------------------
Required for all platforms:
  Python (www.python.org) -  known to work with 2.6 & 2.7 
  SCons (www.scons.org)
  MOZSDKPATH environment variable pointing to the Gecko2 SDK.

Linux:
  Built regularly on Ubuntu 10.4 32bit and 64bit
  Third-Party Libraries
  +libxml2 - sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
  +libcurl - sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
  +Glib    - sudo apt-get install libdbus-glib-1-dev
  +asound  - sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev

Mac OSX:
  Built regularly on OSX 10.6 with XCode 3.2.6
  Links to Framework 10.5

Windows:
  Built regularly on Windows XP & Windows 7 32bit.
  Python path is in runSconsBuild.py and set to c:\python27
  Requires setting environment variables MS_VC_PATH and MS_WINDOWS_SDK_PATH and SCONS_LOCATION
  e.g  SCONS_LOCATION=c:\Python26\Scripts

-------------
2. Building 
-------------
  - Get Gecko2 SDK (32bit) for your platform from 
	 https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/5.0/sdk
  - Extract the package & Set the MOZSDKPATH env variable to point to it
  - Instead of using scons directly, use runSconsBuild.py like this
    'python runSconsBuild.py debug' or
    'python runSconsBuild.py clean'
    Current command line options are 'debug', 'release', 'clean', 'noaddon' and 'x64'.
    
----------
4. Output
----------
  Build will create a standalone test app and an addon for Firefox 4 or 5.
  Test App Exe: TestApp_Softphone
  Addon: ikran-0.2-dev.xpi

-----------------------
5. Testing the addon
-----------------------
  To build  & test 32bit addon , follow below steps

  - Addon executable shall be generated under the <SOURCE>/ikran
 	 called ikran-0.2-dev.xpi
  - OSX
	Start Firefox in 32 bit as 
		arch -i386 /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin 
  - Linux
	Start Firefox normally  
  - Install the addon
  - Test add-on with sample page at
		<SOURCE>/ikran/content/ikran.html		

--------------------------------
6. Using the Test Application
--------------------------------
There are two ways to use the Test Application

 Run the Test Application from the command line with no parameters
  ./tests/testapp_softphone/TestApp_SoftPhone
  
  Enter SIP Server IP address
  Enter SIP Server Username
  Enter SIP Server Password
 
 
 Run the Test Application from the command line with a config file as a parameter
  ./tests/testapp_softphone/TestApp_SoftPhone cfg.txt
    - Sample cfg.txt  (create file named e.g. cfg.txt)

       IP_ADDRESS=10.53.40.5
       DEVICENAME=CSFemannion
       LOGFILE=local.log
       LOCALIP=10.53.50.187

Notes
 IP_ADDRESS = SIP server IP address
 DEVICENAME = name of device config file on SIP server
 LOCALIP = IP address of local network adapter

TestApp Commands
 - ?           -- view commands available
 - d <digits>  -- make call
 - e           -- end call
 - h           -- place a call on hold
 - r           -- resume a held call
 - m           -- mute audio while on a call
 - n           -- unmute audio
 - k           -- video mute
 - j           -- video unmute
 - z           -- enable\disable video
 - v           -- Setup video send direction, send only, sendrecv, revc only, inactive
 - q           -- quit

7. Addon API
-------------
The JS API offers support for 
	SIP Registration, Place Call, HangUp Call & Answer Call

window.navigator.service.call obtains handle to session-control 
object. 

<session-control>.registerUser(user,passwd,sip-proxy,sessObserver);
registers user to the sip-proxy. 
'sessObserver' is a JS function that will be called whenever there is 
a change in the session state such as "no-registrar","registering",
"registered", "incoming-call" & "registration-failed".

On successful registration, one can place call with the below API
<session-control>.placeCall(dial-number, mediaObserver);
where dial-number is number to dial and mediaObserver reports 
significant media state changes suhc as "call-connected",
"call-terminated" as of today.

JS APIs unRegisterUser() and hangupCall() allows de-registration
& end-call functionalities.

Few Points to Note
1. Only Audio is supported on OSX
2. One user is suported
 
Please see content/ikran.html for sample usage of the API.
